## Introduction
The Palmoria Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria that has an embroided issues about gender inequality in its 3 regions where there businesses are located. Unfortunately, the media recently published in the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” this doesn’t look good to the owner of the business on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas.
This documentation outlines the data cleaning process for The Palmoria Group business. Three datasets were given to work on and to know about the issues the company is currently facing. The datasets are given below:
 - The bonus mapping & rules : These contain the rule for making payments to the employees in the company and their work rating
 - The Palmoria Group emp-data : This contains the employees details.

## Problem Statement
 - 1.	What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
 - 2.	Show insights on ratings based on gender
 - 3.	Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
 - 4.	A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
    - 	Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
    - 	Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?
    -  Also visualize this by regions
 - 5.	Calculate the amount to be paid as bonus to individual employees
    - 	Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
    - 	Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
